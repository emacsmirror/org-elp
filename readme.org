* org-elp
  Short for: Org Equation Live Preview. It allows previewing the latex
  fragment while typing. How it works is that it will generate a split
  window and update the preview while typing.

* Installation
  Include the code in your =load-path= and then
  #+begin_src elisp
  (require 'org-elp)
  #+end_src
  A few things can be configured such as how large is the split, the
  length of idle timer, etc. They can be found in =customize-group=.

* How to run
  In the org document that you want to use it, turn on the =org-elp= mode with =M-x org-elp=.
  Running the same command again will turn it off.
